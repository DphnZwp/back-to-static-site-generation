It was assumed that the name Fernandez referred to a family of returnees from Brazil. They would have been the first owners of the property that later would be known as Ilojo Bar. There were indeed several returnees called Fernandez in Lagos' Popo Aguda – the Brazilian Quarter. But recent research has shown that this particular Fernandez was not a returnee, nor was he African. José Amoedo Fernandez was a Spaniard from the impoverished region of Galicia. In the nineteenth century, Galicia was one of the poorest regions of Spain. José Amoedo Fernandez, who was from a mountain village near Vigo, moved to Porto and possibly then to Brazil searching for greener pastures. From Brazil, some of the Gallegos followed the same trajectory as the African returnees to West Africa. No doubt Fernandez was lured by the trade possibilities. By the 1880's Lagos newspapers mention him regularly as a trader of spices and wine with a business on Tinubu Square. When he had traveled to Brazil and Portugal for a long time, a newspaper article in 1892 even welcomed him back to Lagos. The Spaniard purchased half of the plot on Tinubu Square in 1895, and ran his business Fernandez & Co from there.\",\"spans\":[]},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"https://images.prismic.io/lose-your-head-the-client-case/7dc8aa58-e348-429b-ab4f-62aceb4666c2_galician+watercarriers+in+lisbon-early+xx-photo+arquivo+municipal+de+lisboa-by+Joshua+benoliel.jpg?auto=compress,format\",\"alt\":null,\"copyright\":null,\"dimensions\":{\"width\":2048,\"height\":1454}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"https://images.prismic.io/lose-your-head-the-client-case/a29af5df-a28e-4f38-a9ad-0cbfae1aec20_notice+dissolution+partnership.png?auto=compress,format\",\"alt\":null,\"copyright\":null,\"dimensions\":{\"width\":1082,\"height\":1402}},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\" Most likely the name Casa do Fernandez stems from that era. The trading company was one of the biggest in the region. Fernandez did not own the entire plot that the monument we would later come to know as Ilojo Bar until 1903, dating the building much later than always thought in the early twentieth century. Fernandez lived on the top floor, the ground floor space on busy Tinubu Square that was not used for the own business, was rented out. After first partnering with a Portuguese businessman who died unexpectedly at sea, Fernandez sent out for an old friend in Galicia who came to Lagos on his invitation: Napoleon Rey Couto. In the 1910's José Amoedo Fernandez decided to go home for good. He dissolved his businesses and sold his property to his business partner Couto in 1914. His remaining years he spent in Galicia, where he died at the age of 73 in 1938. The Gallego papers mention him regularly as a well respected citizen, but he was never mentioned again in Lagos papers. Couto made a much more lasting impression on the city. He died less than five years after he had acquired Casa do Fernandez, in 1918, in his apartment on Tinubu Square. He was 46 years old. The local weekly described him as a beloved Lagosian: 'though a Spaniard at birth he was very popular with the natives'. After the funeral service in Holy Cross Cathedral, Napoleon Rey Couto was buried in Ikoyi Cemetery. The history of Fernandez' house might not be a story of emancipation from slavery, it remains a story of emancipation: from a second class Spanish citizen who left to return home a wealthy and respected man. And a reminder that economic migration is of all ages.

Even when the records fail to tell a story, some memories remain for centuries. And on Tinubu Square, there are memories attached to the location on Lagos Island where Ilojo Bar used to be. Those memories tell a story of slave trade. They stem from way back, before the Brazilian style house was built around the turn of the nineteenth century. The records in the Land Registry show that before José Amoedo Fernandez acquired the plots on Tinubu Square, the land had been the property of many different people. And one of the early names turning up in these records are the ones of two white slave traders from Brazil: the Martins Jambo brothers. In the mid nineteenth century they shipped many Africans to Brasil from Lagos, which had grown from a fishing village to an economic hub in the Transatlantic slave trade. Even after the Brazilian abolition of slave trade in 1850, some traders kept dealing in human beings trough that route. The Martins Jambo brothers were particularly notorious. Apart from palm oil and other goods, they continued their trade in human beings. Pedro Martins Jambo did so from a house and shop in Lagos, possibly on Tinubu Square. By that time, the British new found stance against slavery – after having been involved in it for centuries – had reached Lagos. That is why the British consul of Lagos, Benjamin Campbell, threw Martins Jambo out of the city in 1853. Martins Jambo was a business partner of Madam Tinubu's, a powerful Yoruba business woman and slave trader in Lagos.\",\"spans\":[]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"She was close to traditional rulers like the Oba of Benin. They tried to invite Martins Jambo back to Lagos, but the slave dealer was never enabled to gain a foothold in the British colony again. This explains why in 1863, two years before Pedro Martins Jambo's death, the property in Lagos was sold. By that time, even Madam Tinubu had been sent away in 1856. She spent the rest of her life in exile in Abeokuta, where the wealthy business woman reportedly had sixty people, mostly enslaved, working for her. This background story gives meaning to memories of the Olaiya family, of whom the family patriarch bought the property on Tinubu Square by auction in 1933. The family remembers finding shackles in the building that would have been used on the enslaved people who were traded through this location. And even though it was impossible to find those shackles in the National Museum where the family says they brought them to in the 1950s, the connection of the location to slave trade should not be dismissed. Also because according to oral history, nineteenth century slave traders from Ekiti who raided villages in the region and captured people, used to take them to the white slave traders in Lagos on Gbambose Street, the back side of what later would become Ilojo Bar. Before it became the Brazilian style building and a national monument, the site seems to have had a connection with the trade in human beings and the transatlantic slave trade. It is a dark story, but one that should not be forgotten.\",\"spans\":[]}],\"images\":[]}},{\"id\":\"Y0ML7REAACQAm6HN\",\"uid\":\"botched-dreams\",\"url\":null,\"type\":\"story\",\"href\":\"https://lose-your-head-the-client-case.cdn.prismic.io/api/v2/documents/search?ref=Y5IelREAACMAOnUk&q=%5B%5B%3Ad+%3D+at%28document.id%2C+%22Y0ML7REAACQAm6HN%22%29+%5D%5D\",\"tags\":[],\"first_publication_date\":\"2022-10-09T17:59:14+0000\",\"last_publication_date\":\"2022-12-02T00:27:03+0000\",\"slugs\":[\"botched-dreams-for-ilojo-bar\",\"7.-botched-dreams-for-ilojo-bar\",\"5.-a-family-house-to-the-olaiyas\",\"3.-a-vip-from-abeokuta-visits-fernandez--house\",\"4.-the-macaulay-connection\",\"5.-a-spanish-migrant-looking-for-greener-pastures\",\"1.-a-spanish-migrant-looking-for-greener-pastures\",\"1.-the-returnees-from-brazil-who-changed-lagos\",\"2.-the-returnees-from-brazil-who-changed-lagos\",\"1.-a-spanish-migrant--looking-for-greener-pastures\"],\"linked_documents\":[],\"lang\":\"en-eu\",\"alternate_languages\":[],\"data\":{\"title\":\"Botched dreams for Ilojo Bar\",\"image\":{\"dimensions\":{\"width\":1403,\"height\":1551},\"alt\":null,\"copyright\":null,\"url\":\"https://images.prismic.io/lose-your-head-the-client-case/de07f8c4-609a-4bf0-a348-67310ca2a303_portrait+of+murray.jpg?auto=compress,format\"},\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"'Secret' and 'confidential' it reads on the letterhead of the Antiquities Department's correspondence in the 1950's concerning Ilojo Bar.

Murray, the first Antiquities Officer, described it as having 'probably the greatest architectural interest of all old buildings in Lagos.' The British wanted to buy it from the Olaiya family and turn it into a museum. The Director of the Department of Antiquities Bernard Fagg wrote that it 'will make a most impressive and valuable museum of Old Lagos.' It should even play a role in the Independence Celebrations.

The Anquities Department declared Ilojo Bar a National Monument in 1956, placing it under the care and protection of the Federal Antiquities Department. The Antiquities Department was the predecessor of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, that nowadays is in charge of these monuments. The NCMM has suffered a structural lack of funding for decades, and is struggling to even keep its own buildings in order.

A detailed measurement of the building was done and an assessment of the cost of restoration made.
