      <div class="story__content svelte-dm2c0n"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>It were the skilled hands of the returnees from Brazil that built Ilojo Bar. That makes the structure as much a part of Lagos&#39; Brazilian heritage as all the other architectural structures designed and built by the Africans who returned to the homeland, even though at no point in its history Casa do Fernandez was owned by Afro-Brazilian returnees.  They were after all the go-to craftsmen and designers of this kind of structures at the time. Between 1500 and 1870 more than 11 million Africans were kidnapped from home and shipped to the Americas in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Out of every ten Africans leaving the Bight of Benin between 1601 and 1867, six were taken to Bahia in Brazil. After the Brazilian abolition of slave trade in 1850, and of slavery in 1888, many of those Africans decided to return to their homeland. Because of the economic possibilities, many of them ended up in cities like Lagos. These relatively well educated newcomers would change the face of Lagos. Once the Afro-Brazilians had discovered Lagos&#39; attraction, the Aguda community in the city grew fast. In 1853, the British counted about 130 families of returnees from Brazil. In 1889 the total number of Afro-Brazilians in Lagos had jumped to five thousand, which was one in every seven residents.</p><p class="block-img"><img src="https://images.prismic.io/lose-your-head-the-client-case/9060f5fa-ab75-43ac-9397-6ef06dc8aa23_Fam%C3%ADlia+brasileira+em+Lagos+Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9+des+Missions+Africaines_+Roma.jpg?auto=compress,format" alt="null" /></p><p class="block-img"><img src="https://images.prismic.io/lose-your-head-the-client-case/184bb2f8-a7d5-458f-9879-19bede2d2f10_araromi+and+water+house+comparison.png?auto=compress,format" alt="null" /></p><p>The returnees built their houses after the image of the places they had left in Brazil, with brightly painted facades and paned windows framed by cast mouldings.

Maybe Fernandez invited Siffre, Nobre and some others to his apartment one evening to discuss the joining of the two houses to construct his dream building.
